1.Blog on difference between HTTP1 Vs HTTP2

HTTP - Hyper Text  Transfer Protocal 

Its used to communicate web clients and server.

HTTP1 was released on 1999 and HTTP2 was released 2015.

HTTP1 was literally slow to communicate web and server like each and every time client sends a request to server and the send back to response.

HTTP2 was improved better than HTTP1.its more faster then HTTP1 
Because HTTP2  is allows multiple request in one connection to server.


Feature os HTTP2 is server push its allows to server  to send resources before clint request 

HTTP1was text based farming and HTTP2 was binary farming
Binary farming reduce the parsing and number of errors compare to text based farming.


HTTP2 is header comparison which can save bandwidth which can reused in same connection. 

2.Blog about Objects and its internal representation in JavaScript

In Javascript object are used in represent complex data structure
And the play critical role in Javascript.
Objects are essential part in javascript programand understanding how they are represented internally is crucial for writing effeciect and effective code

Object in Javascript is unordered collection of key value pairs
Where each key is a string or symbol and each value can be any data type, Including other Objects.

Object in Javascript can be created using object literals ,constructors or classes.

When an Object is created in Javascript its is allocated memory to store its properties and methods 

The internal representation od an Object in Javascript is typically implemented as dictionary or hash table ,where the keys represent the property names and the values represent the property values

 
Javascript engines use a technique called hidden classes to optimize the access to an objects properties.


Javascript also a garbage collector that automatically deallocates memory when objects are no longer referenced .
